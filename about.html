            <p>Buddy.com is inspired by Emily's family pet turtle, Buddy, 龟 (Guī) or Turtle. Here is his story.</p>

            <p>It was the summer of 2004, Emily's family went out to Chinatown, Boston for the Full Moon Autumn Festival. Emily's brother Alex saw baby turtles in a large plastic tub and said that he really wanted one. After a long debate with the parents, the family decided to take two baby turtles home.</p>

            <p>The turtles lived in a tiny tank. The beginning of their lives were simple and not luxurious. A year or two later, one of the baby turtles passed away. Either from starvation due to the other turtle eating most of the food or it was frightened to death. That turtle was then flushed in the toilet. </p>

            <p>Many years pass and the lone turtle continued to live on. Later on the family figured out the gender of the Turtle and it was a boy. He went by a few names, he was either called Buddy, 龟 (Guī) or Turtle. Through out his life, Buddy lived in a small tank with only a one inch height of water with no heating lamp or filter. The only thing he has was a floating rock. Which wasn't even a real rock. Buddy was pretty shy his whole life. He was only comfortable around Emily's mom.</p>

            <p>On October 7th, 2018, Buddy had a traumatic experience. It was his weekly cleaning and Emily's brother, Kevin went to go clean the tank in the bathroom. Once the tank was clean, he carried the tank, with Buddy inside, back to its original spot which was on the other side of their house from the bathroom. On the way, Kevin bumped into the corner of the counter and dropped the tank! The tank shattered and it was like a mini tsunami occurred in the kitchen. Buddy fell down with the tank. Glass was shattered everywhere. The family panicked and were really worried about Buddy. They cleaned up the mess and carefully brought Buddy to the sink in the bathroom. Luckily he was alright. He had a couple tiny cuts on his legs and very minor bleeding (turtles heal fast so he was alright in the end). Poor Buddy.</p>

            <p>Buddy lived in that tank for most of his life, maybe 14 years. He didn't have a home in a home anymore. That day, Emily did a lot of research about Turtles and realized that they have not been taking proper care of the turtle this whole time. Later in the afternoon, the family went out to the pet store to get proper supplies for Buddy's new home! They got a tank that was 2.5 times larger, with a heating lamp, a floating rock, a filter and more food. The family prepared the tank and made sure that everything was all set. During that whole day, Buddy was temporarily left in the sink. Most likely traumatized for life.</p>

            <p>That evening, Buddy was introduced to his new home. He was very nervous at first but eventually got used to it. He loved the spacious swimming area and heating lamp. Since then, Buddy has been given a lot of attention, different foods/treats and lots of love.</p>

            <p>To future pet turtle owners,</p>

            <p>After this experience, I've learned a lot about pet turtles and the proper care it really needs. For first time turtle owners, please make sure to do plenty of research before adopting a turtle. Turtles need special care and are like any other pets. My family pet turtle is an inspiration and mascot for this site and I hope that future turtle pet owners will find all the information they need in order to take care of a turtle.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,<br>Emily Ho</p>
